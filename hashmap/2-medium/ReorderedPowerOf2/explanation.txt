Solution Explanation:

The solution checks if the digits of the given number n can be rearranged to form a power of two. It works as follows:

1. Convert n to a string and count the frequency of each digit using Counter.
2. For all powers of two from 2^0 up to 2^29 (since 2^30 > 10^9), count the frequency of each digit for each power of two.
3. If any power of two has the same digit frequency as n, return True (it is possible to reorder n's digits to form that power of two).
4. If no such power of two is found, return False.

This approach is efficient because there are only 30 possible powers of two to check within the given constraints, and comparing digit counts is fast.
