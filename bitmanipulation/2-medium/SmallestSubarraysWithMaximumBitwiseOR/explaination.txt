go through nums backwards

    compute the OR as you go

    add the or to a precomputed length list what when traversed in order gives the smallest subarray length for that OR


travsese nums forwards

    compute the OR as you go

    also keep a running count

    if the current OR is equal to the target OR 

        break the loop

    append the current count to the result list

return the result list
