1. For each number in the array:
    a. Start a new set for this position, and add the current number to it.
    b. For each value in the set from the previous position:
        - Compute the bitwise OR of the value and the current number.
        - Add the result to the new set.
    c. Update the previous set to be the new set.

2. After processing all numbers, the previous set contains all possible bitwise ORs of subarrays.

3. Return the length of the previous set (the number of distinct bitwise ORs).
