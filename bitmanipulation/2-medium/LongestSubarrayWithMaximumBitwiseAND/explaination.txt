1. Precompute the maximum value in the array (maxVal).
2. Initialize a counter and a variable to track the longest length.
3. For each number in nums:
    a. If the number equals maxVal:
        - Increment the counter.
    b. Else:
        - Reset the counter to 0.
    c. Update the longest length if the counter is greater than the current longest.
4. Return the longest length found.
