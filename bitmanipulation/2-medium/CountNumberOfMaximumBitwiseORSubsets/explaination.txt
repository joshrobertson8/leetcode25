Algorithm Steps:

1. Iterate through all possible subsets of the input list using bitmasking.
2. For each subset:
    a. Compute the bitwise OR of all elements included in the subset.
    b. If the current bitwise OR is greater than the maximum found so far:
        - Update the maximum value.
        - Reset the count to 1.
    c. If the current bitwise OR equals the maximum found so far:
        - Increment the count.
3. After checking all subsets, return the count of subsets that yield the maximum bitwise OR.
