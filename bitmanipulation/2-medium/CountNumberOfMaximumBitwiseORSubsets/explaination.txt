the outer loop iterates through all possible subsets of the input list 

    the inner loop checks each element in the current subsets

        if the current element is included in the subset the bitwise OR is computed
    
    if the current bitwise OR is greater than the maximum found so far, update the maximum and reset the count

    if the current bitwise OR is equal to the maximum found so far, increment the count

return the count of subsets that yield the maximum bitwise OR
