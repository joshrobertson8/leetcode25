2438. Range Product Queries of Powers

You are given a positive integer n. There exists a 0-indexed array `powers` composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]`. Each `queries[i]` represents a query asking for the product of all `powers[j]` with `lefti <= j <= righti`.

Return an array `answers`, where `answers[i]` is the result of the i-th query modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
Output: [2,4,64]

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
Output: [2]

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= lefti <= righti < powers.length
