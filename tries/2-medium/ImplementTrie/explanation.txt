1. Use a TrieNode class to represent each node in the trie, with a dictionary for children and a boolean 'finished' to mark the end of a word.
2. The Trie class has a root node and methods for insert, search, and startsWith.
3. To insert, traverse the trie, creating nodes as needed for each character, and mark the end node's 'finished' as True.
4. To search, traverse the trie for each character; return True only if the end node's 'finished' is True.
5. To check startsWith, traverse the trie for the prefix; return True if all characters are found.

Time Complexity:
- Insert: O(L), where L is the length of the word.
- Search: O(L), where L is the length of the word.
- startsWith: O(P), where P is the length of the prefix.
Space Complexity: O(N * L), where N is the number of words and L is the average length (for all nodes).
