# Leetcode 2025

**Leetcode 2025**, a personal repository documenting my journey through solving Leetcode problems as I learn and master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**.

## Purpose

This repo serves as:

- A **learning log** to track progress in DSA  
- A **reference library** of solved problems with clear code and detailed explanations  
- A way to **reinforce concepts** by documenting not just the solutions, but *why* they work  

## Structure

Each problem includes:

- **Problem Statement** (copied from Leetcode for context)
- **Python Solution** (clean and well-commented)  
- **Explanation** (step-by-step breakdown of logic)  
- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**
