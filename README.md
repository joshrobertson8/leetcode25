# Leetcode 2025

Welcome to **Leetcode 2025**, a curated repository documenting my progress and mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through Python-based solutions to Leetcode problems.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Serve as a comprehensive learning log for tracking DSA progress
- Provide a reference library of solved Leetcode problems with clean, well-documented Python code
- Reinforce algorithmic concepts by including not only solutions, but also clear explanations and complexity analyses

## Repository Structure

For each problem, you will find:
- **Problem Statement**: Directly sourced from Leetcode for context
- **Python Solution**: Clean, readable, and well-commented code
- **Explanation**: Step-by-step breakdown of the solution logic
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity for each approach

## Organization

Problems are organized by topic and difficulty, following a consistent folder structure:
- `<category>/<difficulty>/<problem_name>/`

Each problem folder contains:
- `instructions.txt`: Problem statement and examples
- `solution.py`: Python implementation
- `explanation.txt`: Detailed explanation and complexity analysis
