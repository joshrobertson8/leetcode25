Given an integer n, determine if it is a power of three.

- Return True if n is a power of three, otherwise False.
- n is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that n == 3^x.

Examples:
Input: n = 27
Output: True

Input: n = 0
Output: False

Input: n = -1
Output: False

Constraints:
-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
