1. Compute the maximum bitwise OR (maxOr) by OR-ing all elements in nums.
2. Use a recursive backtracking function to explore all possible subsets:
    a. At each index, you have two choices:
        - Exclude the current element and recurse to the next index.
        - Include the current element (update the running OR) and recurse to the next index.
    b. If you reach the end of the array:
        - If the running OR equals maxOr, increment the count.
3. After exploring all subsets, return the count of subsets whose bitwise OR equals maxOr.
