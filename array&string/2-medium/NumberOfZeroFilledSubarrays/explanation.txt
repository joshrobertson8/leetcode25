1. Initialize two counters: count (for current streak of zeros) and answer (for total subarrays).
2. Iterate through each number in nums:
    a. If the number is 0:
        - Increment count by 1.
    b. If the number is not 0:
        - Reset count to 0.
    c. Add count to answer (each zero extends all previous zero subarrays by one).
3. After the loop, answer contains the total number of zero-filled subarrays.


Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of nums.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a few variables for counting.
