1. Convert num to a string.
2. Iterate through each digit and its index:
    a. If the digit is '6':
        - Change it to '9'.
        - Concatenate the unchanged part after this digit.
        - Break the loop (only one change allowed).
    b. If the digit is '9':
        - Add '9' to the result string.
3. Return the integer value of the result string.
