1. Iterate through the string, keeping only alphanumeric characters and converting them to lowercase.
2. Check if the filtered string is equal to its reverse.
3. Return True if it is a palindrome, False otherwise.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(n), for the filtered character list.
