1. Start at index 1 and iterate while the current index is within bounds.
2. Move the left pointer leftward while:
    a. It is in bounds.
    b. The value equals the current number (to skip duplicates).
3. Move the right pointer rightward while:
    a. It is in bounds.
    b. The value equals the current number (to skip duplicates).
4. If both left and right neighbors are in bounds:
    a. If the current number is greater than both neighbors, increment hills.
    b. If the current number is less than both neighbors, increment valleys.
5. Move the current index to the right pointer (to skip over duplicates).
6. Return the total count of hills and valleys.
