While the current number is in bounds

    while the previous number is in bounds and the same as the current number

        slide over to the previous number so we can avoid duplicates

    while the next number is in bounds and the same as the current number

        slide over to the next number so we can avoid duplicates

    if the right and left numbers are in bounds:

        if the current number is greater than both neighbors, increment hills

        if the current number is less than both neighbors, increment valleys

    update the current index to bypass the duplicates the right skipped over

    return the total count of hills and valleys
